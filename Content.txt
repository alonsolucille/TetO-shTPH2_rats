Results are published in the preprint "Poor decision making and sociability impairment following central serotonin reduction in inducible TPH2-knockdown rats" doi: 10.1101/2024.01.06.574479

The folder contains :
1-the R scripts for the analysis :
-teto.Rproj
-teto_fig_filter_5ht.R for performing the statistical analyses and figures 2, 3, and 4 of the manuscript and supplemental figures S1, S2, and S3.
2-the data :
-teto_all_16082021.csv which are all the behavioral data
-serotonin_19052023.csv which are all the serotonin (hplc) data
